# @vadistic/utils

Another attempt on automating generation of one-off projects. Inspired by https://github.com/microsoft/just

## Why

- I kind of like having monorepos of tiny packages for everything
- Scaffolding tools like tsdx or cra use their configs not mine
- I guess I like configs

## Idea how to make it more or less sane?

- I know nobody have a will to keep such things very updated, so it's mostly scaffolding tool.
- All Stacks (templates) are autogenerated with [plop](https://github.com/plopjs/plop)
- Stacks are based on live `./fixtures` that can be quickly tested/ updated
- Monorepo itself can be scafolded with CLI command from package `@vadistic/scripts` `create-monorepo`
- Exported plopfiles allow scafolding packages & updating dotfiles

- Eslint configs are packaged separately since it's most of the setup and kind of proven solution

## TODO

- [] Add some scripts
- [] Setup automatic composite compilation (project references based on package json)
- [] Test in practice

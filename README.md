# @vadistic/utils

Personal @vadistic utils - scaffolding & configs for react & node monorepos with typescript. Inspired by https://github.com/microsoft/just & https://github.com/nrwl/nx

## Why

- I kind of like having monorepos of tiny packages for everything
- No-config tools like tsdx or cra are not configurable enough...
- Buying into @nrwl/nx is just too much & I'm not a fan of angular repo style
- I guess I like configs ðŸ¤·

## Idea how to make it more or less sane?

- Not yet.
